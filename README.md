# engineering-gui
A simple GUI that helps you calculate the mass, the volume and the moment of inertia of a given piece. This GUI was made during my bachelor studies.

To open the GUI just run "interfata_ssm" script, enter the values of your piece and the results will appear in a second :)

For using this app you will need pillow and tkinter modules
